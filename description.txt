Kalciphoz's RPG Mod

This work is derived from https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/kalciphozs-rpg-mod.63348/

This mod aims to overhaul Terraria by adding RPG elements, and includes a leveling system, an item upgrade system, an elemental damage system, procedurally generated weapons, and much more. For more detailed information, see the wiki.

Features The mod features a leveling system with XP and level display, and rewards you with stat points when leveling up. In order to compensate for gradually increasing player strength, enemies have seen a drastic power increase, especially later in the game.

To further emphasize these changes, I have added prefixes to armour and overhauled accessory prefixes to provide these new stats, including accuracy, leech, critical strike damage multiplier, evasion, and more.


Thanks!
